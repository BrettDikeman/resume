# Resume

My resume is based off pdgessler/pdg-vita. Due to either a bug in GitHub's PDF preview generator or the PDF generated by LuaLaTeX, the first page appears blank when viewed in Github. I've opened a support request with GitHub (who responded in less than 15 minutes, whoa.) Direct download link: 
[brett_dikeman_resume.pdf](https://github.com/BrettDikeman/resume/raw/master/brett_dikeman_resume.pdf "Resume for Brett Dikeman, System Administrator")

Please note that the markdown version is currently just a placeholder/example from that repo. I'll be generating a markdown version of my own resume soon.
